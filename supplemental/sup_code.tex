\subsection{Counting Comparison}
To compare BITS with BEDTOOLS {\tt intersect} and UCSC Genome Browserâ€™s
(``UCSC'') {\tt bedIntersect}, we used internal timers based on the standard C
library function {\tt gettimeofday()}.  Since BEDTOOLS and BITS perform more
sanity checks on input files than {\tt bedIntersection}, wall-time would
unfairly penalize BEDTOOLS and BITS.  Furthermore, since {\tt bedIntersect} only
supports enumeration, the output volume of {\tt bedIntersect} can be much larger
than BITS (which reports a single number) and wall-time would unfairly penalize
{\tt bedIntersect}.  To exclude these differences from the results, we added
timers to the source coude of the BEDTOOLS {\tt intersect} and 
{\tt bedIntersect} source code to ensure that file input was not included in the
reported execution time, and all file output commands were commented out.\\
\textbf{TODO: Source code for these times is available at: ???.}
