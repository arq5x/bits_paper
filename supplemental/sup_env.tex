\subsection{Computing Environment}
Sequential run-times were measured on a 2.0 GHz qua-core Intel Xeon E5504 with
4 MB of cache running Ubuntu Linux version 4.4.3 (kernel version 2.6.32-41).
Run-times for CUDA were measured on an NVIDIA Tesla C2050 GPU with 448 1.15 GHz
cores, 3 GB of global memory, CUDA driver version 4246739, and CUDA runtime
version 4.0. The source code was compiled using gcc version 4.4.3, and NVIDIA
CUDA compilation tools release 4.0, V0.2.1221. Run-times do not include the
time required to initialize the GPU.
